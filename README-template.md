## My process

I started the project by assigning the folder architectures, I decided to add sass to the project, then I assigned the tags to the html, I set the variables and colors in the sass, then I started styling the project in mobile first mode, then I added the styles in mediaquery for desktop screen in mediaquirys, and in the end I made the intersections of the menu buttons with js.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I had to go over the nth-child() property to generate a grid and assign it to the location I needed.

`&>div:nth-child(1){
        grid-column: 1/2;
        
        
      }`
